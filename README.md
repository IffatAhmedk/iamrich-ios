# I Am Rich

Introducing myself to iOS Development following Angela Yu's course on [iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/). 

Starting with the very basic 'I am Rich' App. 
What I learned: 
  - How to create a new project
  - Different panes and navigating around XCode
  - Creating UI with the object library
  - Adding AppIcon and Assets to the project
